# NURBGM
A Computational Graphics Engine in Python and implemented using [processing.py](http://py.processing.org/). The name of the project comes from a amalgamation of NURBS and BGM - NURBS being [Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline) and BGM being the acronym for [Prof. B Gurumoorthy](http://cpdm.iisc.ac.in/cpdm/facultyprofile.php?name=3).

NURBGM is a computational graphic engine used to explain different curves encountered in Computer Aided Design. This project stems from a course taken by the author at CPDM, Indian Institute of Science Bangalore. This course ([PD212 - Computer Aided Design](http://cpdm.iisc.ac.in/cpdm/curriculum.php)) was instructed by Prof. B Gurumoorthy as a hardcore course for the MDes students.

The idea behind this is to visually explain the following curves using animation so that a student can understand it with intuition. 

- Parametric Curves
- Hermite Curves
- B-Spline Curves
- Rational B-Spline Curves
- Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline Curves (NURBS)

This project is hosted on the website here and the animation can be played with.
