# NURBGM
A Computational Graphics Engine in Python and implemented using processing.py. The name of the project comes from a amalgamation of NURBS and BGM - NURBS being Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline and BGM being the acronym for Prof. B Gurumoorthy.

NURBGM is a computational graphic engine used to explain different curves encountered in Computer Aided Design. This project stems from a course taken by the author at CPDM, Indian Institute of Science Bangalore. This course (PD101 - Computer Aided Design) was instructed by Prof. B Gurumoorthy as a hardcore course for the MDes students.

The idea behind this is to visually explain the following curves using animation so that a student can understand it with intuition. 
- Parametric Curves
- Hermite Curves
- B-Spline Curves
- Rational B-Spline Curves
- Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline Curves (NURBS)

This project is hosted on the website here and the animation can be played with.
